        <h2>TAJ MAHAL</h2>
        <img src="./taj.jpg" width="300">
        <p> The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of
            Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house
            the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre)complex,
            which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a
            crenellated wall.
            Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643 but work continued on other phases of the
            project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in
            1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2015 would be approximately
            52.8 billion rupees (U.S. $827 million).The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the
            guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.</p><a

        <p>
            Goa is a state with a coastline of beautiful beaches running all the way from top to bottom. It is famous
            for them and it would be pretty much impossible to take a trip to Goa without visiting at least one. The
            amount of beach options may be slightly overwhelming so I, Jules, am here to give you a little explanation
            of what each beach has to offer and hopefully help you decide which beach meets your holiday needs best.
